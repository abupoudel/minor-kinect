# Please note that trainer.py is just a image capturing file.
# Press 'p' to save Positive images and 'n' for Negative ones
# i.e. Background. The trainig of those files should be performed
# seperately commandline and may take lots of days. During 
# training.py please create your own folders named "positive" and 
# "negative" so to save all the images during capturing.
# These folder shall contains thousands of image samples for each
# instance so that may exceed the size, so commiting the directories
# was quiet dizzy.
